Here is my story.

Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale,
A tale of a fateful trip
That started from this tropic port
Aboard this tiny ship.

The mate was a mighty sailin' man,
The Skipper brave and sure.
Five passengers set sail that day
For a three hour tour,
A three hour tour.

The weather started getting rough,
the tiny ship was tossed.
If not for the courage of the fearless crew,
The Minnow would be lost,

The ship set ground on the shore of this
Uncharted desert isle
With Gilligan,
The Skipper too,
The Millionaire and his Wife,
The Movie Star,
The Professor and Mary Ann,
Here on Gilligan's Isle.
